## A Real-Time Chat Application

[Live Demo](https://hchc-chat-app.herokuapp.com/)

## Introduction

This is the source code of my implemented real-time chat app, hosted on Heroku. Just enter a display name, a room, and be able to chat with others in the same room as you.
The chat app makes use of web sockets to be able to chat in real time.

## Features

* Chat with people in the same room
* Location sharing
* Display of individuals in the same room as you

## Known bugs

* If a '#' is put in as the query parameter string, the app will crash and will be down for a while.
